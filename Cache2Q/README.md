# 2Q Cache Emulator

This will be my cache emulation in course of C++ in MIPT 2nd year (First task). There will be gradual development from C programming language to C++.

## Task

1. Functionality

   Get input stdin:

   * cache size
   * number of elements to check cache
   * elements to check cache (elements are int)

   Give in stdout:

   * number of cache-hits

   Emulate cache use with 2Q algorithm. Then compare with perfect cache (which knows the future).

2. Functional tests for cache.

3. Perfect Cache Emulation.

   * determine which algorithm will be great to find first element, that should be removed from cache.


## Build

```shell
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
```

## Usage

This paragraph will be improved in future versions.

```shell
./Cache2Q
```
